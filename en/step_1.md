The `picozero` library allows you to enter real musical notes to make tunes to play on your speaker. A coding system has been created to help you with this. 

The coding system uses a **letter** to represent the musical note and a **number** to represent where the note appears on the grand stave (staff).

For example, the **middle C** (see above) is at the centre of the grand stave and uses the code `c4`.

+ A **high C** uses the code `c5`
+ A **low C** uses the code `c3`

When you go up the grand stave, the number increases. When you go down the grand stave, the number decreases. 

**Representing sharps**

Your musical score might include notes that are sharps. These are represented using a `#` symbol. In the example below, the first not is a C sharp. The code for this is `c#4`.

**Representing flats**

Your musical score might include notes that are flats. These are **also** represented using a `#` because the library doesn't have a specific code for flats.
